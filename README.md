Can a computer see similarity like a human? 

The inspiration for this project comes from a [NIH paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7666026/#R17) that demonstrates how human object similarity can be recreated through an embedding matrix and a modeling algorithm. Our implementation strives to achieve the same objective but leverages a neural network instead.
